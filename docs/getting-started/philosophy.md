# Philosophy

I created this plugin after [bringing internationalization (i18n) support to MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/pull/2299). Once themes could be translated, it was time to help authors (you) localize their pages' content!

Since translating content is a cumbersome task I tried (hard) to remove as much boilerplate as possible for authors and translators as possible. This materialized in features like automatic localization of content so that you can localize assets such as images without having to care about their localized name and use the same reference in your MarkDown source whatever the language!

This plugin will do its best to provide best in class support for `mkdocs-material` users as well as some other plugins which are listed in the compatibility section of this documentation.

I hope you get a smooth and satisfying experience in using this plugin, enjoy!
